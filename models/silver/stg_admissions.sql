-- stg_admissions  (SILVER) — INCREMENTAL
-- Why this layer exists: dedup, cross-row window logic, real readmission
-- detection, and row-level data-quality gating.
--
--The gatekeeper validates
-- every file and loads it into RAW.PATIENT_ADMISSIONS, so this model now
-- reads ONE source table (no more Snowpipe + GK_ union).
--
-- INCREMENTAL STRATEGY (patient-scoped):
-- Readmission detection needs each patient's FULL history (LAG over
-- prior admissions). A naive "new rows only" incremental would miss
-- readmissions whose prior admission is an old row. So on incremental
-- runs we reprocess the COMPLETE history of any patient who received a
-- new/updated admission since the last run. This keeps window functions
-- correct while processing far less than a full rebuild.
